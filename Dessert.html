                    Dust a flat work surface lightly with flour. Unroll puff
                    pastry and roll out to a rectangle. Spread a thin layer of
                    herbed cream cheese over the puff pastry. Cover with Swiss cheese
                    slices, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll puff pastry up tightly like a jelly roll.
                    Slice puff pastry roll in 1/4-inch-thick slices and
                    lay on the prepared baking sheet.
                    Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until
                    lightly browned and puffed up, 15 to 20 minutes.

                        Beat egg and water together in a small bowl.
                        Cut two rounds from each sheet of puff pastry using a 3-inch round cutter, forming 8 circles. 
                        Use a 2 1/2-inch round cutter to cut through 4 of the rounds. Place entire cut round on top of an 
                        un-cut round. Brush each with egg mixture.
                        Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
